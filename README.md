Elite Dangerous Bodies Parser
--

This tool allows you to query an offline dump of the Elite Dangerous starmap for bodies that match very narrow coordinates.
It is meant to fill in the gaps for when the search pages on EDSM and EDDB aren't granular enoguh for your query.

It is designed to work with an offline copy of the galaxy dump kindly provided by spansh (https://downloads.spansh.co.uk/galaxy.json.gz). Big thank you to spansh, EDDB, EDSM, and everybody involved in the Elite Dangerous community mapping effort!

# Usage

First, download and extract the galaxy.json file from the link above. Make sure you have enough space. It was 161 GB uncompressed when I developed this tool, and will only get bigger over time.
